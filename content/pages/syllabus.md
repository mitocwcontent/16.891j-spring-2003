Assignment Types
----------------

There are three kinds of assignments for the seminar:

*   [Reading]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/readings). Most weeks there will be extensive reading assigned. Please come to class prepared to discuss the readings for the week.
*   [1-pg Memos]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments). A 1-page memo on a relevant topic will be due almost each week. These 1-page memos are meant to be no more than 1 page, and are typical of what a high-level decision maker would expect when they ask you for background information or your recommendation.
*   [Group Term Project]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/projects). Includes researching the issue, writing a paper/model, making a presentation to the class, and preparing reading materials for the class in preparation for the presentation. The group project will be a study of the technological, architectural and policy options associated with developing a new reusable launch vehicle.

Information on each of these is available throughout the rest of this course.
